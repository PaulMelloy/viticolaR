Description: Mechanistic model which estimates Downy Mildew (Plasmopara viticola)
 primary inoculum production, dispersal from overwintering inoculum. The model 
 also estimates the infection process of the dispersed zoospores. Model translated
 from the scientific literature, Rossi et al. 2008, Ecological Modelling, 212, 
 p480-491.
