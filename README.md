# viticolaR
A mechanistic compartment model to assist in fungicide decision support for 
downy mildew (*Plasmodia viticola*) infections in grapevines.
This model is translated and adapted from 
[A mechanistic model simulating primary infections of downy mildew in grapevine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380007005881)
by Vittorio Rossi, Tito Caffi, Simona Giosue and Riccardo Bugiani. 
This paper was first published in Ecological Modelling in **2008**.

## Getting started  
### Installing the package
Install the R package and dependency (`epiphytoolR`) from github using the following 
code

```r
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/PaulMelloy/epiphytoolR")
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/PaulMelloy/viticolaR")
```

### Format weather data  
The model only requires clean weather data formatted with `epiphytoolR::format_weather()`
function.
The package contains a clean dataset `nt_weather` which is already formatted using
this method.
See [example code](https://github.com/PaulMelloy/viticolaR/blob/main/data-raw/DATASET.R)
for how to format weather data from BOM sources, including m=imputing missing 
weather data.  

### Running the model  
```r
NT_DMod <- estimate_DM_PI(nt_weather)
```

### Inspecting model output  

Return a summary of the model  
```r
summary(NT_DMod)
```

Get a formatted table output of each state variable

```r
get_PI_dates(NT_DMod)
```

#### Plot model progress  

Plot weather data  

```r
plot_weather(NT_DMod)
```

Plot oospore cohort progress  

```r
ggplot2::ggplot() +
  geom_line_viticolaR(v_mod)
```

Add a ribbon layer to show when sporangia have fully matured and dispersal is 
possible
```r
ggplot2::ggplot() +
  geom_line_viticolaR(NT_DMod)+
  geom_ribbon_viticolaR(NT_DMod)+
  ggplot2::ylim()
```
