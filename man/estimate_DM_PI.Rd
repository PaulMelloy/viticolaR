\title{Estimate Downy Mildew Primary Infections}
\usage{
estimate_DM_PI(w, Start = "detect", End = "detect", SOD = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{w}{hourly weather data.table, class epiphy.weather.}

\item{Start}{POSIXct, date time in UTC when to start the model running. By default
the function will 'detect' the start of the model. This model is configured
for the southern hemisphere, so the model will start on the first of July of
the first year of weather data input into the model 'w'.}

\item{End}{POSIXct, date time in UTC when to end the model running. By default
the function will 'detect' the end of the model. This model is configured
for the southern hemisphere, so the model will End on the last day of June in
the first season year of the input weather data 'w'.}

\item{SOD}{Proportion of seasonal oospores dose. This starts as 1 in the middle
of winter, the first of June for the southern hemisphere or the 1st of January
in the northern hemisphere. Also referred to as 'morphologically mature oospores
(MMO).}
