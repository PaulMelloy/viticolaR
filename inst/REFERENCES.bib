              We report for the first time the occurrence of an
              Eutypella
              species on cotton in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The putative
              Eutypella
              was isolated from dead cotton plants that exhibited atypical symptoms of either Fusarium or Verticillium wilt. Dead plants had symptoms resembling lightning strike damage with blackened outer bark around the fifth node zone. Internal vascular discoloration was reddish grey and often occurred in V-shaped sections. Sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) revealed a 93.7–94.1\% similarity to
              Eutypella scoparia
              , indicating that the NSW cotton isolates represented a putatively novel species within the
              Eutypella
              genus. Pathogenicity of the isolated
              Eutypella
              was assessed on cotton stem cuts and living plants inoculated with culture agar plugs. Typical black necroses on outer bark and reddish vascular discoloration were reinduced in both
              Eutypella
              -inoculated stem cuts and living plants. Subsequently, the same
              Eutypella
              pathogen was successfully recovered, thus fulfilling Koch’s postulates. The detection of
              Eutypella
              on NSW cotton is believed to be an independent event from a recently reported occurrence of
              Eutypella
              on Queensland cotton. The Queensland detection occurred in the same 2017/18 cropping season at approximately 730 km apart and was associated with distinct
              Eutypella
              isolates.},

	abstract = {A mechanistic model was developed to predict secondary infections of Plasmopara viticola and their severity as influenced by environmental conditions; the model incorporates the processes of sporangia production and survival on downy mildew (DM) lesions, dispersal and deposition, and infection. The model was evaluated against observed data (collected in a 3-year vineyard) for its accuracy to predict periods with no sporangia (i.e., for negative prognosis) or with peaks of sporangia, so that growers can identify periods with no/low risk or high risk. The model increased the probability to correctly predict no sporangia [P(P−O−) = 0.67] by two times compared to the prior probability, with fewer than 3\% of the total sporangia found in the vineyard being sampled when not predicted by the model. The model also correctly predicted peaks of sporangia, with only 1 of 40 peaks unpredicted. When evaluated for the negative prognosis of infection periods, the model showed a posterior probability for infection not to occur when not predicted P(P−O−) = 0.87 with only 9 of 108 real infections not predicted; these unpredicted infections were mild, accounting for only 4.4\% of the total DM lesions observed in the vineyard. In conclusion, the model was able to identify periods in which the DM risk was nil or very low. It may, therefore, help growers avoid fungicide sprays when not needed and lengthen the interval between two sprays, i.e., it will help growers move from calendar-based to risk-based fungicide schedules for the control of P. viticola in vineyards.},

	abstract = {A dynamic model for Plasmopara viticola primary infections on grapevine was elaborated according to a mechanistic approach. Development of the sexual stage of the pathogen was split into different state variables, in which changes from one state to another were regulated by rates depending on environmental conditions. The conceptual model was based on the definition of a primary inoculum season, a seasonal oospore (inoculum) dose, and its division into many coeval cohorts. Each cohort progresses along the primary infection cycle (production and survival of sporangia, release, survival and dispersal of zoospores, infection, appearance of disease symptoms) simultaneously, with a time step of one hour. The model was evaluated over a 12-year period (1995–2006) in Emilia-Romagna (Northern Italy) by comparing simulations with actual observations of the first seasonal symptoms of downy mildew in 43 vineyards. This data set was not used in model building and represents different environmental conditions, with both early and late primary infections. The model showed high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. The achieved probabilities that an oospore cohort produce or not an infection were 0.994 and 0.999, respectively, while there was practically no probability that an oospore cohort produce infection when infection is not predicted by the model. Because of a small probability ({\textless}0.01) that a predicted infection is not a true infection, confidence in prediction of non-infections was higher than in prediction of infections. Most of the wrong positive predictions occurred in early season, when the host was in the earlier growth stages, or when the oospore germination was triggered by isolated weak rain events. Considering that neither calibration nor empirical adjustment of model parameters were necessary to obtain accurate simulation, it was concluded that this model produces a reasonable approximation of the primary infection processes underlying oospore development. The model showed that 86\% of the oospore cohorts failed infection, because sporangia did not survive till zoospore release (5.6\% of these cohorts), zoospores released from sporangia did not survive until dispersal (83.6\%), or the zoospores that dispersed to leaves did not cause infection (10.8\%).},

	abstract = {The complex interactions of Plasmopara viticola with environment and host make grapevine downy mildew an ideal candidate for disease forecasting. However, a forecasting model is only as good as the knowledge used to build it, and DMCast is no exception. We addressed some knowledge gaps concerning this disease: (i) initial timing and span of primary infection; (ii) survival of the lesions and sporangia; and (iii) critical period of fruit susceptibility. Experiments revealed that, though emerging shoots are susceptible earlier than previously thought, primary infection frequently occurs near the confluence of a specific host phenological stage and certain weather conditions. Primary infection also may trigger new epidemics later in the season than was traditionally hypothesized. Lesions declined with repeated sporulation cycles but, contrary to prior reports, not age alone. Sporangia died within 8 h on dry, warm days but retained high viability on cooler days. With controlled inoculations, we determined that in the New York climate, fruit of several cultivars (Chardonnay, Riesling, Concord, and Niagara) become resistant to infection by 2 to 3 weeks post-bloom. These studies have clarified several knowledge gaps and long-held assumptions that have direct implications for improving disease forecasting and disease management.},

	abstract = {Downy and powdery mildews are major grapevine diseases. In organic viticulture, a few fungicides with protectant activities (copper and sulphur in particular) can be used, and their preventative application frequently leads to unneeded spraying. The adoption of an epidemiological disease forecasting model could optimise the timing of treatments and achieve a good level of disease protection. In this study, the effectiveness of the EPI (Etat Potentiel d’Infection) model in predicting infection risk for downy and powdery mildews was evaluated in nine organic vineyards located in Panzano in Chianti (FI), over a 2-year period (2020–2021). The reliability of the EPI model was investigated by comparing the disease intensities, the number of fungicide sprayings, the quantities of the fungicides (kg/ha), and the costs of the treatment achieved, with or without the use of the model, in a vineyard. The results obtained over two seasons indicated that, in most cases, the use of the EPI model accurately signalled the infection risk and allowed for a reduction in the frequency and cost of spraying, particularly for powdery mildew control (−40\% sprayings, −20\% costs compared to the farmer’s schedule), without compromising crop protection. The use of the EPI model can, therefore, contribute to more-sustainable disease management in organic viticulture.},

The model simulates the development of downy mildew on the basis of climatic conditions. The inputs to the model are: temperature and leaf wetness for the inoculation phase, temperature and relative humidity for the incubation phase and the type of treatment applied. Numeric or graphic outputs are available. The program provides useful information for identifying fungicide application times on the basis of the actual downy mildew development. Field validation tests performed in untreated rows show a good correlation between field observed and model simulated infections. Moreover the model identifies only three treatment distribution periods, while with the traditional method six treatments were applied.},
